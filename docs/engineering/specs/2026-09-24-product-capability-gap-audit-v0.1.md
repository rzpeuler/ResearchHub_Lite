# RHL-NEXT-001 Product Capability Gap Audit v0.1

Date: 2026-09-24
Status: `AUDIT_COMPLETE / SOL REVIEW PENDING`
Baseline: `main == origin/main == e5b3b5dc7fe938b59442ef9a631365e669afaf38`
Audit branch: `codex/next-product-capability-gap-audit`
Audit worktree: `C:\Users\Administrator\Desktop\ResearchHub_Lite_worktrees\NEXT_AUDIT`

This is an analysis-only audit. It does not implement the recommended phase and
does not alter runtime code, tests, source adapters, schemas, or Knowledge data.
Source code and executable contracts are authoritative where prose and code
disagree. “Ready” below means ready within the bounded product scope evidenced
by the repository and acceptance records; it does not mean every external
provider is available.

## Executive Summary

ResearchHub Lite has a substantial bounded research product: the application
runtime, HTTP/SSE and Pi-host path, company/industry/earnings/valuation/event
workflows, Daily morning/evening pipeline, report and bundle persistence,
provenance, and the Gateway → validated ChangeSet → Writer → reload boundary
are implemented and tested.

The largest product break is the transition from research output to maintained
investment knowledge. Thesis formalization and refresh calculations exist, and
Daily change assessment can safely project existing Claims. However, a normal
user journey does not yet connect new earnings/Daily/event evidence to a
durable thesis refresh, an explicit ReviewDecision, and a user-visible
resolution/learning outcome. `thesis_lifecycle` is registered but dispatched
directly to a deterministic function; it has no normal ResearchService-backed
durable run or dedicated HTTP/Pi launch path. ReviewCases are durable and
readable, but ReviewDecision execution remains explicitly deferred.

Prediction and outcome evaluation are also absent as a product capability.
The schema has forecast semantics, but the repository does not provide a
prediction creation, outcome acquisition, scoring, or evaluation loop.

Recommended next phase: **Thesis Lifecycle Product Closure**, kept thin and
Workflow-owned. It should connect existing thesis refresh, Daily change
assessment, Earnings evidence, ReviewCase, Gateway, Writer, and report/runtime
surfaces without introducing a generic Agent Runtime, Planner, Capability or
Provider layer, a universal data bus, a new store, or a second canonical write
path.

## Current Product Architecture

The implemented architecture is a local-first Node runtime with React/TypeScript
and Vite client surfaces, HTTP JSON plus SSE, direct Pi SDK embedding, and a
mounted Knowledge Base. `ApplicationRuntime` constructs Knowledge, Review,
Workflow, Production, Research, Daily, and dispatch services. The server exposes
bounded research launch routes, Knowledge projections, reports, bundles, Daily
briefs, and read-only review cases.

The product boundaries are coherent:

- Workflow owns deterministic execution control and routing.
- Skill owns professional semantic methodology.
- Plugin owns external capability integration.
- Knowledge mutation passes through the Production Gateway, validated ChangeSet,
  Writer, reload, and revision checks.
- Daily signals are runtime monitoring artifacts. Only eligible proposals may
  enter canonical Knowledge.
- Pi/Codex is the configured reasoning host; no custom Agent Runtime or Pi RPC
  subprocess architecture is present.

The normal launch surface is strongest for Company, Industry, Earnings,
Valuation, Event, Thesis Red Team, and Daily Intelligence. Reports, bundles,
Knowledge graph, and review cases are query surfaces. The client deliberately
labels the Knowledge graph and review surfaces read-only.

## Company Research

Company Research is a real normal product path with a dedicated HTTP route,
ResearchService adapter, Workflow definition, evidence acquisition, report
validation, and canonical proposal boundary. The workflow composes a broad set
of implemented Skills and has real configured-Pi validation evidence.

The remaining limitation is downstream: Company Research produces a profile
and proposals, but it does not itself establish a durable thesis snapshot,
create a maintained prediction set, or schedule a review of later outcomes.
This is a product workflow/lifecycle gap, not a reason to redesign the company
workflow.

## Industry Research

Industry Research is the strongest externally validated research capability.
The accepted TEST-054 artifact records all eight modules, 24 qualified public
evidence items, a Gateway/Writer ChangeSet, canonical reload, and a validated
16-section report. Provider failures and 21 research gaps are retained as
explicit limitations rather than averaged or fabricated.

No next phase should reopen Industry architecture merely to increase provider
count. Any future improvement should be a separately evidenced source/data
closure.

## Earnings

Earnings Review has exact fiscal-period inputs and deterministic checks for
period, time, quality, and report contracts. The registry maps consensus,
variance, guidance, financial quality, estimate revision, expectation gap, and
thesis refresh Skills. Real configured-Pi Earnings completion is recorded.

The important missing transition is after the review: the result is not a
durable, user-resolvable thesis refresh with explicit proposition deltas,
review cases, and later outcome checks. Consensus and revision evidence also
remain dependent on configured public source availability.

## Valuation

Valuation is a bounded product capability. The current Workflow exposes PE,
PB, and EV/EBITDA methods and composes DCF, reverse-DCF, comps, and scenario
Skills under the quality gate. Real configured-Pi completion is recorded.

Advanced valuation breadth is a research-method candidate, not the highest
leverage next phase. The current product can already expose a bounded valuation
artifact; it cannot yet connect valuation assumptions to a maintained thesis or
an evaluated forecast.

## Thesis

The repository contains real deterministic thesis semantics. `formalizeThesis`
validates proposition identity, dependencies, sources, and cycles. `refreshThesis`
applies point-in-time evidence, retains unchanged propositions, and evaluates
kill predicates. The lifecycle Workflow composes those calculations with
expectation gap, catalyst map, and optional red-team input.

The product seam is incomplete. The Workflow registry advertises
`thesis_lifecycle`, but dispatch handles it with `Promise.resolve(runThesisLifecycle(...))`
rather than a normal ResearchService run. There is no equivalent
`startThesisLifecycle` service, HTTP launch route, client form, durable report
contract, or automatic trigger from Earnings/Daily evidence. The lifecycle
quality-gate input also has no sources by construction, and missing red-team or
other optional inputs are represented as skipped/diagnostic states rather than
an integrated product path.

## Continuous Research

Continuous Research is intentionally bounded to Daily Intelligence. The
maintenance report records a real Pi FIX-003 run, Daily Change Assessment,
existing Claim projection, Gateway/Writer/reload, replay protection, and
explicitly excludes a generic cross-workflow scheduler.

That bounded decision is architecturally correct. The remaining gap is not a
generic engine: it is the final action boundary that tells a user which
tracked thesis or assumption changed, what proposal was produced, whether a
ReviewCase is required, and how the user closes it.

## Daily

Morning and Evening are durable report surfaces with an existing scheduler and
bounded acquisition composition. D5 preserves the existing orchestrator and
adds explicit market, expectations, institutional-activity, and exact D4
industry lanes when truthful. The current real evidence is deliberately
partial: CNINFO is usable while other lanes can be empty, rate-limited, or
bridge-blocked. This is represented as unavailable material rather than
synthetic coverage.

Daily is therefore operationally useful but not a complete user learning loop.
Signals can safely support/update/contradict/review existing Claims, but there
is no product-level thesis decision or prediction outcome closure.

## Prediction

No dedicated prediction workflow, launch route, durable prediction object,
outcome-ingestion path, scoring calculation, or evaluation report was found in
the source tree or acceptance inventory. The Knowledge schema distinguishes a
forecast from confidence, which is a useful foundation, but schema vocabulary
is not a product capability.

Prediction should remain out of the recommended phase unless the forcing
question below shows that thesis maintenance cannot be useful without it.

## Review / Evaluation

Review Governance v0.1 deliberately establishes durable, recoverable open
ReviewCases first. `ReviewService` lists and loads them, and the client exposes
them read-only. The architecture specifies the required future sequence:
current Knowledge reload, proposal re-binding, applicable Diff/Resolution,
ResolutionIntent, ChangeSet, Validation, and Writer.

The same governance document explicitly defers full ReviewDecision execution.
The final external validation inventory marks ReviewDecision writes
`DESIGN_ONLY_DEFERRED`. This is a real product gap, but implementation must
preserve the current Writer boundary and must not turn the ReviewCase reader
into direct canonical mutation.

There is also no evaluation loop for whether a prior forecast, thesis
proposition, or catalyst was correct. Review currently means governed
knowledge resolution, not measured investment-learning evaluation.

## Knowledge

Knowledge production is a strength and should be reused. The Gateway builds
bounded proposals and resolution intents, persists actionable ReviewCases,
validates a ChangeSet against the current revision, writes through the shared
Writer, and reloads the canonical handle. Existing Claim update, supersede,
contradict, and review resolutions are present for the Daily path.

The gap is lifecycle ownership by consumers. Thesis lifecycle results are not
yet carried through the same durable product chain, and ReviewDecision is not
yet implemented as a current-Knowledge re-evaluation before Writer execution.

## Reports

Research reports have explicit types for Company, Industry, Earnings,
Valuation, Event, Thesis Red Team, and Daily Brief. Validation requires
subject refs where applicable, timestamps, workflow/revision metadata, and
source/claim reference shape. The Reports and Bundles pages make results
inspectable.

Reports currently terminate most flows. The next phase should add a bounded
link from a report/proposal to a thesis refresh or ReviewCase, not a new report
framework.

## Interaction

The application supports target selection, bounded workflow launch, asynchronous
status, reports, bundles, source search, Knowledge graph inspection, and review
case reading. It does not yet support the complete journey:

```text
select target
  → research / monitor
  → identify thesis or expectation impact
  → propose a bounded canonical change
  → user resolves or defers ReviewCase
  → refresh current Knowledge
  → record prediction/outcome learning
```

The missing interaction is not a general dashboard issue. It is the explicit
decision and lifecycle handoff between existing evidence surfaces.

## External Constraints

- Industry has an accepted bounded real-data result: CNINFO, MIIT, and CPCA
  supplied qualified evidence while GDELT, Eastmoney, and AKShare remained
  explicit failure/empty outcomes.
- Daily remains `PARTIAL_EXTERNAL_PROVIDER_COVERAGE`; current evidence includes
  usable CNINFO and bounded failures or empties for GDELT, RSS, institutional,
  community, and AKShare probes.
- Provider credentials, login, CAPTCHA/MFA, paid APIs, broker accounts, and
  trading execution remain out of scope.
- Configured-Pi validation is real evidence for completed workflows, but it is
  not evidence that every provider lane or every optional semantic input is
  available.
- No source averaging, fabricated fallback, or fixture-backed production
  acceptance is permitted.

## Redundant / Dead Infrastructure

No large redundant infrastructure removal is authorized by this audit. The
following are boundaries or potentially misleading surfaces that should be
treated carefully in the next phase:

- The `thesis_lifecycle` registry entry is useful metadata and deterministic
  test seam, but its direct dispatch adapter should not be mistaken for a
  complete durable product workflow.
- Daily catalog entries that are reference-only or metadata-only are not
  acquisition paths; D5 correctly requires explicit active composition.
- ReviewCase advisory fields and the Review Governance state-machine prose are
  foundations, not implemented ReviewDecision actions.
- Forecast terminology in the schema is not a prediction/evaluation engine.

The audit found no justification to delete these foundations. Any cleanup must
first prove that a surface is not a contract or test seam.

## Gap Classification

Counts below are distinct material findings; one finding may have more than one
classification. They are not counts of files or test failures.

| Gap type | Count | Material findings |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `RESEARCH_METHOD_GAP` | 2 | No prediction/outcome evaluation method; valuation method breadth remains bounded |
| `PRODUCT_WORKFLOW_GAP` | 4 | Thesis lifecycle launch/durability; post-earnings/Daily thesis handoff; ReviewDecision execution; prediction learning loop |
| `KNOWLEDGE_LIFECYCLE_GAP` | 3 | Thesis refresh is not durably projected; review resolution is not executed; prediction outcomes are not canonical/evaluable |
| `DATA_GAP` | 3 | Daily provider breadth; earnings expectations/revisions; governed prediction outcome data |
| `SOURCE_RELIABILITY_GAP` | 2 | External Daily lanes; source availability/authority for expectations and outcomes |
| `INTERACTION_GAP` | 2 | Read-only review interaction; no report-to-thesis decision handoff |
| `OBSERVABILITY_GAP` | 1 | No accepted end-to-end telemetry for evidence → thesis decision → outcome learning |
| `DOCUMENTATION_ONLY` | 0 | No material gap is documentation-only; the remaining issues have runtime/product consequences |

## Next-Phase Candidates

### 1. Thesis Lifecycle Product Closure

Connect existing `thesis_lifecycle`, `thesis_refresh`, Earnings, Daily Change
Assessment, ReviewCase, report, and Gateway/Writer semantics into one bounded
normal product path. Add only the minimum durable run, proposal, review, and
runtime interaction needed to make the current thesis maintainable.

Value: closes the central user journey with the least architectural expansion.
Risk: requires a precise decision about which inputs are mandatory and which
remain explicitly unavailable.
Out of scope: prediction scoring, generic scheduling, new provider layers, and
direct client canonical writes.

### 2. ReviewDecision and Governed Resolution Closure

Implement the specified current-Knowledge re-evaluation and user decision
sequence for selected ReviewCase categories, ending in the existing Gateway,
ChangeSet, Validation, and Writer path.

Value: makes human governance operational.
Risk: larger interaction and governance surface; should follow or be paired
with a concrete thesis use case rather than becoming a universal action system.

### 3. Prediction and Outcome Evaluation

Define a narrow prediction contract, issue time/PIT rules, outcome source
authority, outcome binding, scoring, and evaluation report. Link results to
claims/theses only after Review Governance decisions are clear.

Value: creates a true learning loop.
Risk: highest data/source ambiguity and a high chance of accidentally creating a
generic prediction framework.

### 4. Daily and Earnings Source Coverage Closure

Improve only the already identified provider lanes and expectation/revision
inputs, preserving explicit unavailable states, source authority, and PIT
rules.

Value: improves breadth of an already useful pipeline.
Risk: external availability is uncertain and does not by itself close the user
decision loop.

### 5. Advanced Valuation Method Closure

Add one narrowly selected valuation method with source-backed assumptions and
acceptance evidence, reusing the existing valuation Workflow and report path.

Value: improves analytical depth.
Risk: lower product leverage than thesis/review closure and should not create a
generic method/provider abstraction.

## Recommended Next Phase

`RECOMMENDED_NEXT_PHASE: THESIS_LIFECYCLE_PRODUCT_CLOSURE`

The next phase should make one target journey complete:

```text
company / thesis selected
  → bounded Earnings, Daily, Event, or explicit refresh evidence
  → thesis proposition delta and unchanged-preservation result
  → quality-gated proposal and report
  → ReviewCase when binding/decision is unresolved
  → current-Knowledge re-evaluation
  → existing Gateway → validated ChangeSet → Writer → reload
  → visible status, refs, and next action
```

The phase should reuse existing contracts and preserve fail-closed behavior.
It should not implement prediction scoring, broad ReviewDecision categories,
new provider infrastructure, a generic continuous engine, or a new Knowledge
store in the same phase.

## Forcing Question

When new evidence contradicts a tracked thesis, what exact user-visible and
canonical state transition must occur without manual file/API intervention—and
which decision must remain human-owned?

The phase should not begin implementation until this is answered for one
bounded target journey, including the behavior for unavailable evidence,
stale Knowledge revision, unresolved identity, and an explicit user defer.

## Provisional Completion Gate

The recommended phase is provisionally complete only when all of the following
are evidenced on the configured product path:

1. A user can select an existing company/thesis and launch a normal, tracked
   thesis refresh; the run is not a direct in-memory-only function call.
2. The refresh consumes dated evidence with explicit source refs and PIT
   filtering, returns proposition deltas, unchanged propositions, kill
   assessments, diagnostics, and a validated report.
3. A supported update/contradict/review proposal reaches the existing Gateway,
   validated ChangeSet, Writer, reload, and revision path; no client or Skill
   writes canonical Knowledge directly.
4. Unresolved identity, stale revision, missing required evidence, unavailable
   provider lanes, and replay are fail-closed or explicitly unavailable with
   durable diagnostics.
5. An actionable ReviewCase is durable before successful completion, and the
   user can inspect the case and its evidence/dependencies. If a decision
   action is included, it must re-bind against current Knowledge before Writer.
6. At least one real configured-Pi run demonstrates the complete bounded
   journey using live accepted evidence; fixtures remain offline regression
   support only.
7. Tests cover deterministic PIT/no-drift/kill behavior, Gateway/Writer
   integration, replay/idempotency, stale revision, unavailable evidence, and
   the HTTP/client launch and status path.
8. `npm run typecheck`, the applicable focused/full validation, and
   `git diff --check` pass, with no architecture-boundary violations.

This gate does not require a generic cross-workflow scheduler, all Daily
providers, prediction scoring, or full ReviewDecision category coverage.
