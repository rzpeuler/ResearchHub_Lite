# RHL-EXEC-003-A-004 — Unified Research Product E2E & Readiness Closure

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED / SOL ACCEPTANCE PENDING
**Branch:** `codex/exec-003-a-004-unified-product-e2e`
**Baseline main:** `87f55224c1c7389dba75b41b6e6ec39bc1f986bc`
**Product readiness:** ENGINEERING_READY; CORE_PRODUCT_READY not established.

## 1. Baseline & Git State

A-003 commit `87f55224c1c7389dba75b41b6e6ec39bc1f986bc` was verified as an ancestor of `origin/main`. The A-004 worktree was created from that exact clean `origin/main`; baseline evidence is in [RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-baseline.json](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-baseline.json). The root checkout was left untouched. A-004 is not merged to `main`.

## 2. Scope and Architecture Compliance

Work stayed within Company Research, Valuation, Earnings Review, their existing Application/Workflow/Skill/Plugin paths, runtime status restoration, and required parser cancellation behavior. No new Agent Runtime, orchestration framework, Knowledge schema, provider framework, or product line was introduced. Existing `ResearchService`, `ResearchDispatchService`, `DataResolver`, `SourcePolicy`, Pi ModelRuntime, ResearchReport, ResearchBundle, Gateway, and Writer boundaries remain authoritative.

## 3. User Entry Points

| Entry | Evidence and result |
|---|---|
| ResearchRun UI → RuntimeClient → HTTP Application API | Client tests cover selection, input, start, run ID restoration, polling exhaustion, resume, terminal state and report/bundle navigation. Real HTTP product-start E2E is in the two HTTP artifacts in Sections 14–15. |
| `ResearchDispatchService.startAsync` → verified identity → production binding → `ResearchService` → Workflow → Bundle | `tests/app/services/research-dispatch-security-identity.test.ts` now executes the production Valuation binding through the DataResolver, checks unresolved market data, and reloads a matching blocked Bundle. |
| Pi Application Tool → `ResearchService` → Company Workflow | `tests/app/pi/research-company-tool-integration.test.ts` invokes the actual `research_company` tool against `ResearchService`, reloads the Report, verifies run identity and confirms the mounted Knowledge tree is unchanged. |

The deterministic Pi tool integration uses controlled provider data. The separate live Pi ModelRuntime result is recorded in Section 16. No browser automation was used to claim an HTTP E2E.

## 4. Company Research

The real 002487 HTTP run completed with verified identity, one AKShare structured source and ten usable CNINFO sources in the earlier capped run. Its report and bundle reloaded, the report carried six HTTPS links, and its isolated Knowledge tree did not change. A second capped run saved the full generated report in [RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-report-002487-company.json](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-report-002487-company.json): identity and cutoff are explicit; provider-returned financial observations carry period and publication date and are labeled `CURRENT_VALUE_ONLY`; unavailable profile/market values and unsupported sections remain explicit gaps. It does not assert units or historical numeric value versions that the data did not prove.

The live snapshot had a CNINFO timeout and no profile fields. It contains a bounded financial report rather than a full investment thesis. The older capped run had usable CNINFO evidence; both artifacts are retained so the source outcome difference is visible. A report's section count is not used as a quality proxy.

## 5. Valuation

The 002487 and 600519 live HTTP comparisons both stopped with `VALUATION_MARKET_PRICE_UNAVAILABLE`. Financial transport returned 70 rows for 002487 and 103 for 600519; fiscal-year basis and official publication metadata were available, but no eligible market rows/price were available. PE/PB eligibility alone did not authorize an output without price. Reports were not fabricated; blocked bundles were reloaded. Freshness, exchange calendar coverage, PE/PB calculations, publication timing and PIT guards remain covered by focused deterministic suites, including A-002's 143 freshness tests.

## 6. Earnings Review

002487 FY2025 and H1 2026 both returned `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`. CNINFO parsing exceeded the configured 600-second bound; AKShare observations did not satisfy the exact-period official filing gate. Each run produced an explicit blocked state, no false earnings report, a reloaded Bundle, and an unchanged isolated Knowledge tree. `ACTUAL_VS_CONSENSUS_REAL_DATA_GAP` remains a valid gap when no qualifying consensus is available. The 600519 FY/H1 attempt results are recorded in Section 15 after the current real run completes.

## 7. Verified Security Identity

Live 002487 evidence resolves `002487 / 大金重工 / SZSE` from `akshare_security_directory`; current Pi ModelRuntime evidence uses the same identity. Production Dispatch passes one identity handoff into the ResearchService binding and rejects conflicting exchanges before provider execution. First-run unverified Company identity blocks instead of creating a Company through a write-enabled request. Deterministic identity and Pi tool tests verify same-symbol/exchange consistency.

## 8. Data Source and PIT

Company financial rows retain provider-returned period end and publication time; unsupported units and historical value-version proofs are not inferred. Valuation only uses a price when DataResolver validates its source, session freshness, exchange calendar coverage, analysis cutoff and period metadata. Earnings applies exact fiscal period, official filing/publication timing and current-value versus historical-PIT gates. The real evidence distinguishes AKShare, CNINFO, GDELT and configured market fallbacks and records unavailable sources.

## 9. Knowledge Read-only Integrity

Every real HTTP artifact hashes the complete isolated Schema 0.4 Knowledge tree before and after. All recorded runs show identical paths and SHA-256 digests, including first Company research without a canonical Company. Pi tool integration also snapshots the complete tree. Tests cover Raw archive, manifests, registry and other Knowledge-owned paths. Reports/Bundles use application-owned report and bundle stores only.

## 10. Authorized Knowledge Write Control

`writeKnowledge=false` prevents Gateway dry-run submissions from producing Raw archive or registry side effects and prevents temporary references from becoming canonical refs. Existing verified Company subjects remain readable. Unverified first-run identity cannot bypass identity governance even when a caller asks for writes. Authorized writes still use the existing Knowledge Production Gateway, validated ChangeSet and Writer; no direct canonical-write path was added.

## 11. Workflow Lifecycle and UI

The UI preserves the active run ID and restores status polling after navigation/reload; users can resume tracking after the default polling window. Pending Bundle status does not show a premature open action. Tests cover completed, completed-with-review, blocked, failed and cancelled projections, and prevent a cancelled run from later being represented as completed. Docling parser timeout/cancellation now terminates the process tree instead of leaving the Workflow indefinitely active.

## 12. Report/Bundle Reconciliation

Real HTTP runs reload Report and Bundle by their persisted IDs. For completed Company runs, Report `workflowRunId`, Bundle `workflowRunId` and requested run ID match. Blocked Valuation/Earnings runs retain explicit terminal status and a reloadable Bundle without inventing a Report. Dispatch integration asserts the same run ID and blocked terminal status in the persisted Bundle.

## 13. Cross-Workflow Consistency

The two-symbol matrix attempts Company, Valuation, FY2025 Earnings and H1 2026 Earnings in isolated Schema 0.4 Knowledge. One Company run completed, but no symbol completed the required Company → Valuation → Earnings triplet because market price and exact-period official filing evidence were unavailable. Identity, timeline semantics, report IDs, bundle IDs and read-only isolation are checked independently; dates are not collapsed into a single cutoff.

### Formal product acceptance matrix

Each cell records the observed evidence, including blocked cells; `blocked` means a safe explicit gap, not a successful research result.

| Acceptance dimension | Company Research | Valuation | Earnings Review |
|---|---|---|---|
| User input correct | HTTP request includes 002487, SZSE, verified name and `maxSources=1` in [Company artifact](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-002487-company-cap1.json). | HTTP request includes symbol, exchange and PE/PB methods in [Valuation comparison](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-valuation-comparison.json). | HTTP attempts explicitly use 002487 FY2025 and H1 2026 in [002487 matrix](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-e2e-attempt-002487.json). |
| Verified security identity | `002487 / 大金重工 / SZSE`, source `akshare_security_directory`, in Company artifact. | Same resolved security in Valuation comparison; mismatch checks in `research-dispatch-security-identity.test.ts`. | Same resolved security and source in 002487 matrix. |
| Real Provider | AKShare usable source and CNINFO 10 usable sources in the capped Company run; GDELT unavailable. | Financial transport succeeded but market transport/eligible price did not; recorded as blocked, not usable valuation. | AKShare returned one usable source, but CNINFO official evidence failed for the requested periods. |
| PIT / exact period | Financial rows include period/publication dates and explicit `CURRENT_VALUE_ONLY`; see full report snapshot. | FY basis and official publication verified; historical numeric version and eligible market price are not claimed. | FY2025 and H1 2026 exact-period gates were applied; no substitute-period actuals are used. |
| Deterministic data quality | Provider observations and profile/market gaps are listed in [full Report snapshot](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-report-002487-company.json). | `VALUATION_MARKET_PRICE_UNAVAILABLE`; no PE/PB result is emitted without eligible price. | `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`; source timeout does not become a result. |
| Semantic result / fallback | Company Report completed with bounded facts and explicit gaps; live Pi timeout used deterministic fallback (Section 16). | Safe blocked result; no model estimate substitutes for missing deterministic inputs. | Safe blocked result; no actual-vs-consensus comparison is fabricated. |
| ResearchReport | Company report reloaded; `reportType=company_research`, exact `workflowRunId`, 19 report sections and real HTTPS evidence links. | No Report is emitted for the blocked run; report reference is absent in the valuation artifact. | No Report is emitted for either blocked exact-period run. |
| ResearchBundle | `research-bundle-d73ca28d-b685-409a-8e39-3268c5913430`, reloaded and tied to the same run. | Blocked Bundle reloaded for each symbol; terminal state matches the run. | Both blocked Bundles reloaded; terminal state matches each run. |
| Read-only Knowledge | Full isolated tree SHA-256 unchanged in the Company artifact and the full report snapshot run. | Full isolated tree unchanged in valuation comparison. | Full isolated tree unchanged in 002487 matrix. |
| Report reference authenticity | 4 HTTPS links in the capped run; no canonical refs are asserted without persisted source objects. | No Report or canonical refs are fabricated for the blocked run. | No Report or canonical refs are fabricated for blocked runs. |
| Application status consistency | HTTP 202 start; workflow `completed`; Report and Bundle IDs share `runId`. | HTTP start/status reaches `blocked`, reason is preserved, Bundle reloads. | HTTP start/status reaches `blocked`, exact gap is preserved, Bundles reload. |
| Report / Bundle reload | Report and Bundle `workflowRunId` equal the request `runId`. | Bundle reload validated; no Report exists to open. | Bundle reload validated; no Report exists to open. |

## 14. Real 002487 E2E

Evidence: [capped live attempt](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-e2e-attempt-002487.json), [maxSources=1 Company run](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-002487-company-cap1.json), [Valuation comparison](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-valuation-comparison.json), and [full Company report snapshot](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-report-002487-company.json).

| Workflow | Result | Reload / isolation |
|---|---|---|
| Company Research | Run `3a9b9279-6bde-4ced-91f5-b18f9920c6eb`: `REAL_PROVIDER_COMPLETED`; AKShare 1 usable source, CNINFO 10, GDELT unavailable. | Report and Bundle reloaded; 6 HTTPS links; Knowledge tree unchanged. The additional maxSources=1 run is `d73ca28d-b685-409a-8e39-3268c5913430`. |
| Valuation | Run `08d231f6-ad1b-46d5-9ee7-144999620856`: `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`; `VALUATION_MARKET_PRICE_UNAVAILABLE`. | No fabricated Report; blocked Bundle reloaded; tree unchanged. |
| FY2025 Earnings | Run `c349c1f2-fda8-4a48-98e2-7100468d3217`: `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`; `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`. | No fabricated Report; Bundle reloaded; tree unchanged. |
| H1 2026 Earnings | Run `c878f2b7-2c8f-4d90-a292-f4d818573762`: `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`; `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`. | No fabricated Report; Bundle reloaded; tree unchanged. |

The initial uncapped attempt is retained as `REAL_HTTP_E2E_INCOMPLETE` because it exceeded the intended source bound; it is not used as the final Company result.

## 15. Real 600519 E2E

Evidence: [600519 live HTTP matrix](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-http-600519-e2e.json), [full Company Report snapshot](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-report-600519-company.json). All four capped live runs finished. All four have synchronized terminal states, matching and reloadable Bundles, unchanged read-only Knowledge trees, and the final tree digest matches the initial digest. A Report is present only for the completed Company run; its absence on blocked runs matches their empty `reportRef` and Bundle `reportId`.

| Workflow | Run / result | Source and artifact evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Company Research | `546a40b8-f6e4-4181-99ae-e7fee61b74e1`, `REAL_PROVIDER_COMPLETED`. | AKShare returned one usable source; CNINFO and GDELT failed. Report reloaded with identity `600519 / 贵州茅台 / SH`; full report saved; Bundle reloaded. |
| Valuation | `17d64146-742d-471c-906e-e7aaf884a192`, `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`: `VALUATION_MARKET_PRICE_UNAVAILABLE`. | Market price unavailable; no valuation Report was fabricated. The blocked Bundle reloaded and agrees with the terminal Workflow status. |
| FY2025 Earnings | `eaa578ac-adfc-493a-8bbd-d2ddb48e2af6`, `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`: `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`. | AKShare returned one usable source; CNINFO timed out at 600,000 ms. The blocked Bundle reloaded and agrees with the terminal Workflow status. |
| H1 2026 Earnings | `224c4eaa-8d13-4163-b3aa-f83c72cb2c7d`, `REAL_PROVIDER_BLOCKED`: `EARNINGS_PERIOD_EVIDENCE_UNAVAILABLE`. | AKShare returned one usable source; CNINFO timed out at 600,000 ms. The blocked Bundle reloaded and agrees with the terminal Workflow status. |

## 16. Pi ModelRuntime Outcomes

Evidence: [real Pi ModelRuntime HTTP run](../../../tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-004-real-pi-http-e2e.json). Configured model `zhipu-openapi/glm-5.3-flash` was invoked through `PiReasoningExecutor`; `company_research_synthesis` timed out at 180,021 ms. The existing deterministic, evidence-bounded Company fallback completed, and Report/Bundle reloaded with matching run ID. Classification is `REAL_MODEL_FALLBACK`, not model completion. The Knowledge tree remained unchanged.

## 17. Focused Tests

The final focused identity, production Dispatch and Pi Application Tool integration command is `node --import tsx --test tests/app/services/research-dispatch-security-identity.test.ts tests/app/pi/research-company-tool-integration.test.ts`: 13/13 pass. Additional workflow, route, report, DataResolver, PIT, parser timeout, cancellation and UI tests are included in the full regression run below.

## 18. Full Regression Comparison

Clean-main baseline at `87f55224c1c7389dba75b41b6e6ec39bc1f986bc`: client 122/122 pass; Node 2,169 pass and 21 fail (2,190 total). Final full regression: client 124/124 pass; Node 2,178 pass and 21 fail (2,199 total). Exact `(file path, test title)` comparison shows **0 new failures**, **0 baseline failures missing**, and all 21 failure IDs match. One earlier concurrent run had an additional timeout-sensitive reasoning failure; it passed in isolation and did not recur in the final full run.

Other final validations: server `npm run typecheck` passed after the added integrations; `npm run client:typecheck` passed; `npm run client:build` passed with the existing >500 kB chunk warning; `git diff --check` passed.

## 19. Known Product Gaps

- No real sample completed all three required workflows in the same Runtime.
- EastMoney market transport failed in the live comparison; the available fallback did not yield an eligible current market row.
- Official CNINFO PDF parsing exceeded its 600-second timeout in the affected earnings attempts.
- The Pi model call timed out; deterministic fallback completed the Company run.
- The full Company report snapshot has financial observations but no usable company profile; many methodology sections correctly remain gaps.
- Company structured financial data does not prove historical numeric value versions, so `CURRENT_VALUE_ONLY` remains explicit.

## 20. Product Readiness Decision

**ENGINEERING_READY.** Read-only Knowledge integrity, identity gating, PIT and source-quality guards, Report/Bundle contracts, UI status recovery, parser cancellation and the exact baseline failure comparison are covered. **CORE_PRODUCT_READY is not declared**: the required one-symbol Company/Valuation/Earnings completed triplet and fully reviewable reports are not available from the attempted live sources. `PERSONAL_RESEARCH_V1_CANDIDATE` is therefore also not reached. The remaining limitations are data/model availability, not fabricated success.

## 21. Final Commit and Branch State

This report and implementation are delivered on `codex/exec-003-a-004-unified-product-e2e`; final delivery verifies the pushed branch HEAD against the commit containing this report and confirms a clean worktree. The exact full SHA is included in the task delivery. This task does not merge A-004 to `main`.
