# RHL-EXEC-003-A-003 — Earnings Review Live Data & Expectations Closure

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED / SOL ACCEPTANCE PENDING
**Date:** 2026-10-10
**Branch:** `codex/exec-003-a-003-earnings-live-data`
**Baseline:** `origin/main` at `015d41431775953523ffd4d3dd753581fdf5e2fe`
**Implementation commit:** `cb4eec7` (`feat(earnings): close live actual data workflow`), followed by the audited report/runtime contract fixes recorded in the final delivery commit.

## 1. Baseline & Git State

The A-002 commit is an ancestor of `origin/main`. A-003 was built in the isolated `EXEC_003_A_003` worktree from the clean `015d414` baseline. No merge to `main` was performed. Final branch SHA, remote SHA, and worktree cleanliness are recorded after commit and push.

## 2. Current Earnings Runtime

Production execution now resolves official filing and structured actual requirements through the existing Earnings Review Workflow and DataResolver policies, invokes the registered CNINFO and AKShare acquisition plugins, and supplies accepted, period-bounded metrics to the Earnings Review Skill. The application entry point is `ResearchDispatchService.startAsync`; report and ResearchBundle persistence remain owned by the existing runtime. Deterministic fallback now reports supported actuals and derived growth/margin metrics while keeping unsupported cash flow, consensus, valuation, and guidance conclusions explicitly unavailable.

## 3. Official Filing Probe

All four target-period attempts retrieved an issuer-matched CNINFO filing with an exact fiscal period. The first `002487.SZ FY2025` dispatch did not start because identity resolution returned `unresolved_reference`; it is retained in the original live artifact. A retry using the verified exchange-qualified identity completed through the application path.

| Security / period | Filing | Announcement | Published (UTC) | Result |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| 002487.SZ, FY2025 | 大金重工 2025年年度报告 | 1224997956 | 2026-03-05 16:00 | Available; retry completed |
| 002487.SZ, H1 2026 | 大金重工 2026年半年度报告 | 1225489611 | 2026-08-21 16:00 | Available |
| 600519.SH, FY2025 | 贵州茅台2025年年度报告 | 1225114741 | 2026-04-16 16:00 | Available |
| 600519.SH, H1 2026 | 贵州茅台2026年半年度报告 | 1225475868 | 2026-08-14 16:00 | Available |

The exact official URLs, retrieval timestamps, formal document types, and correction relations are preserved in the per-run evidence. All four final dispatches verified the requested issuer and exact period; no adjacent period or issuer was substituted. Filing selection requires identity, fiscal year, period, publication time, and the formal filing preference; future filings and unlinked corrections fail closed.

## 4. Actual Financial Data Probe

CNINFO supplied official document evidence. AKShare retrieved structured actuals published by EastMoney. The numeric value-version remains **UNVERIFIED** for all aggregator values; CNINFO filing publication does not prove the aggregator's historical numeric revision. Amounts below are CNY; EPS is CNY/share. YoY and margin changes are deterministic calculations against the comparable prior-year period.

| Security / period | Revenue | Net profit | Gross margin | EPS | Revenue YoY | Net profit YoY | Gross-margin change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 002487, FY2025 | 6,173,550,246.46 | 1,103,297,424.75 | 31.1839% | 1.73 | +63.3365% | +132.8246% | +135.5961 bps |
| 002487, H1 2026 | 3,252,515,191.59 | 600,567,001.92 | 37.5255% | 0.94 | +14.4793% | +9.8902% | +935.5819 bps |
| 600519, FY2025 | 172,054,171,890.91 | 82,320,067,101.68 | 91.1796% | 65.66 | -1.2001% | -4.5323% | -75.1665 bps |
| 600519, H1 2026 | 92,278,072,083.21 | 44,516,880,421.86 | 89.5552% | 35.57 | +1.3001% | -1.9516% | -174.4097 bps |

Operating cash flow was unavailable in the retrieved structured actuals; it was not filled with zero. The deterministic Skill output reports available revenue, profit, margin, EPS, and comparable growth, and marks cash conversion unavailable. The gross-margin delta contract now uses `basis_points` consistently with the value and rendered report.

## 5. Fiscal Period & Unit Validation

The four periods are kept distinct (`FY` versus `H1`). Actual and comparator rows must match the requested fiscal period; annual estimates cannot satisfy H1 comparisons. Revenue/profit are normalized to CNY, gross margin and YoY values to percent, EPS to CNY/share, and gross-margin differences to basis points. Missing, invalid, future, incomparable, or conflicting values do not become usable metrics.

## 6. Numeric Version / PIT

Current-view reports may display sourced aggregator actuals with `CURRENT_VALUE_ONLY` / `UNVERIFIED` status. Fixed historical `asOf` requests still require the existing numeric value-version proof and block when the current aggregator response cannot prove that version. Official filing publication metadata is not treated as proof of an aggregator value revision. No PIT requirement was relaxed.

## 7. Expectations Source Ladder

The production SourcePolicy retains THS forecasts as primary, EastMoney individual research reports as fallback 1, and the already-registered legacy EastMoney route as fallback 2. FY2025 runs attempted THS and EastMoney and returned no usable expectations. H1 runs returned 20 THS estimates from 10 institutions; fallback was not selected after the primary returned estimates. Each estimate keeps institution, analyst, metric, fiscal period, unit, value, publication time, source candidate, original publisher, retrieval provider/time, and the issuer page for THS's institution forecast table (`https://basic.10jqka.com.cn/<ticker>/worth.html`) in the Earnings Snapshot. Provider attempts, empty/error reasons, and source counts are in the real E2E JSON. The final current-code H1 run verifies this source URL is rendered; the source candidate does not contain a per-report PDF URL, so the report links to the official company forecast table and preserves its individual source candidate ID.

## 8. Consensus & Revisions

No run produced a qualified consensus snapshot or a linked same-institution estimate revision. The 2026 H1 THS rows concern FY2026 and were published after the official H1 result cutoffs, so they do not constitute H1 consensus. The FY2025 samples had no usable estimate rows. Consensus and revision counts are therefore zero; no estimate was synthesized or averaged.

## 9. Actual vs Consensus Qualification

**ACTUAL_VS_CONSENSUS_REAL_DATA_GAP.** Every run has zero qualified actual-versus-consensus comparisons. Forecast period, metric, unit, publication cutoff, issuer, and institution identity requirements remain in force. FY forecasts were not compared with H1 actuals.

## 10. Financial Quality

Revenue and net-profit YoY, gross-margin movement, and available quality checks are deterministic. Operating cash flow, cash conversion, working-capital cycle, and FCF checks remain unavailable because required cash-flow and balance inputs were not returned. Unavailable components are enumerated in the persisted reports.

## 11. Management Guidance

No usable management-communication record was accepted in these runs. Diagnostics include no accepted CNINFO IR records and unsupported exchange routes for the current D2 path. Model timeouts did not create guidance or operating claims.

## 12. Valuation Impact & Thesis Filter

No verified consensus or expectation finding mapped to valuation inputs, so the report marks valuation implications unavailable. Read-only executions used `writeKnowledge=false`; unsupported evidence did not create thesis-impact claims or durable proposals. This does not alter the existing W4 Thesis Filter boundary.

## 13. ResearchReport & Bundle

Completed Workflow runs persisted and reloaded a 14-section ResearchReport and its ResearchBundle. Reports include verified security identity, period, filing metadata, financial publisher and retrieval provider, exact actuals, value-version status, evidence URLs, derived metrics, expectation source ladder and available forecasts, and explicit data gaps. Earnings Workflow results now retain financial-quality, expectation-analysis, and quality-gate status through the Application service boundary. Only real HTTPS evidence URLs are emitted; no synthetic canonical refs are added.

## 14. Real 002487 E2E

The final acceptance run completed both FY2025 and H1 2026 through `ResearchDispatchService.startAsync`. Both returned verified identity, exact CNINFO filings, usable structured actuals, 14-section report reloads, persisted Bundles, and unchanged isolated Knowledge. FY2025 expectation providers returned no usable forecasts; the H1 run produced 20 FY2026 forecasts from 10 institutions, with no period/cutoff-qualified H1 consensus. An earlier unresolved-identity dispatch remains documented in the original live artifact; it is not counted as a successful acceptance run.

## 15. Real 600519 E2E

The final acceptance run completed both FY2025 and H1 2026 with exact-period CNINFO filings and EastMoney financial values retrieved through AKShare. Both reports and Bundles reloaded. FY2025 expectation providers returned no usable forecasts. H1 returned 20 FY2026 forecasts from 10 institutions, with no qualified H1 consensus because the rows are annual and post-result. Financial reports mark numeric value versions `UNVERIFIED`; gross-margin movement is rendered in basis points.

## 16. Real Pi ModelRuntime

The normal application invoked `zhipu-openapi/glm-5.3-flash` for earnings synthesis in all four production runs. Both FY2025 outputs were validated and applied. Both H1 model calls timed out and were not applied; the deterministic Skill fallback completed the base review. This records both successful model synthesis and actual timeout/fallback behavior without attributing unsupported conclusions to the model.

## 17. Knowledge Read-only Validation

Every final live run used an isolated Schema 0.4 Knowledge Base and `writeKnowledge=false`. The before/after canonical object count remained 0, the digest remained unchanged, and report source/claim refs were empty. The final artifact records four persisted Bundles and zero canonical delta for each run. No user's mounted Knowledge Base was modified.

## 18. Full Test Results

- Focused Earnings/DataResolver/W2, THS acquisition/source URL, and official-disclosure suite after the final runtime/report fixes: **133/133 passed**.
- `npm test`: **2,167 passed, 21 failed of 2,188**. Against the A-002 baseline (**2,159 passed, 21 failed of 2,180**), exact normalized failing test names are identical: **0 new failures, 0 baseline failures cleared**. Full identifiers are committed in `tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-test-comparison.json`.
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm run client:typecheck`: PASS.
- `npm run client:build`: PASS; existing Vite warning reports a 638 kB minified client chunk.
- `git diff --check`: PASS (Windows line-ending conversion warnings only).

## 19. Remaining Data Gaps

- Actual-versus-consensus is a real data gap for all four periods; no same-period, pre-result consensus was available.
- Aggregator numeric historical versions remain unverified; fixed historical PIT use is blocked.
- Operating cash flow and inputs for working-capital/FCF quality are unavailable.
- Management-communication data was not accepted for these samples.
- H1 Pi synthesis timed out and deterministic fallback supplied the report narrative; both FY synthesis calls were validated and applied.
- H1 actual-versus-consensus remains a genuine source/period/cutoff gap; the annual forecasts are preserved and explicitly not compared with H1 actuals.

## 20. Final Commit & Delivery Status

Status remains **IMPLEMENTED / SOL ACCEPTANCE PENDING**. The final four-run live artifact is `tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-final-live-e2e.json`; the final current-code H1 source-provenance artifact is `tests/validation/evidence/RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-final-provenance-600519-h1.json`. A-003 is delivered on `codex/exec-003-a-003-earnings-live-data`; it is not merged into `main`. The final branch SHA, pushed remote SHA, and clean worktree are verified after commit and push and included in the delivery handoff. E2E artifacts are under `tests/validation/evidence/`.

### Root causes

- Earnings Review called the Knowledge Production Gateway for read-only and no-Company runs with `writeKnowledge=false`. The Gateway dry-run path can still persist Raw Archive/Raw Registry state, so the caller's read-only intent did not guarantee a read-only Knowledge Base.
- Reports projected Source/Claim references from Gateway outcomes without verifying every emitted reference against the mounted Knowledge Registry. Local proposals or dry-run IDs could therefore be presented as canonical references without durable objects.
- Financial normalization guessed that unqualified gross-margin values with magnitude at most one were ratios. This misread legitimate sub-one-percent values and left the value's unit dependent on a numeric threshold rather than the source field contract.
- Structured EastMoney actuals retained publisher and retrieval-provider names but dropped the selected source URL before it reached the report evidence link.

### Affected paths and implementation

- `workflows/earnings-review/workflow.ts` now derives `effectiveWriteKnowledge` from both caller permission and the presence of canonical Company coverage. When false, it skips Gateway submission entirely; reports, diagnostics, analysis, and Bundles still complete. When true, the existing persistence route remains enabled.
- After an authorized Gateway submission, every returned reference across supported canonical object types is checked against the actual Schema 0.4 registry. An unpersisted reference blocks the run instead of entering the report.
- `plugins/research-acquisition/earnings-financial-normalization.ts` now interprets percent and ratio fields by explicit aliases. Ambiguous generic numeric fields and conflicting gross-margin fields fail closed. `plugins/research-acquisition/akshare.ts` records EastMoney `XSMLL` as `gross_margin_percent` at the adapter boundary.
- `plugins/research-acquisition/earnings-data.ts` carries the selected EastMoney API URL to the report's structured financial source and HTTPS evidence link. CNINFO filing PDFs remain distinct issuer-document evidence.
- Regression coverage in `tests/workflows/earnings-review.test.ts` exercises all four write-permission/Company-coverage combinations, checks complete Knowledge file-tree equality for read-only cases with a valid proposal, and verifies authorized persisted references. Gross-margin cases cover 0.5%, zero, negative, explicit ratio 0.42, 42%, percent strings, ambiguous fields, conflicting units, and basis-point recomputation.

### Read-only no-write and Raw registry evidence

The current-code production E2E used a fresh isolated Schema 0.4 Knowledge Base for each run. The evidence runner snapshots every file and directory path and file SHA-256 before and after the run; the four current-code deterministic-fallback runs all report an unchanged tree and revision `0 -> 0`.

| Run | Canonical Entity / Source / Claim | Revision | Knowledge tree | Raw Registry |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| 002487.SZ FY2025 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 -> 0 | unchanged | unchanged in full tree snapshot |
| 002487.SZ H1 2026 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 -> 0 | unchanged | unchanged in full tree snapshot |
| 600519.SH FY2025 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 -> 0 | unchanged | unchanged in full tree snapshot |
| 600519.SH H1 2026 | 0 / 0 / 0 | 0 -> 0 | unchanged | unchanged in full tree snapshot |

The current-code live-Pi FY2025 artifacts also record full-tree equality, revision `0 -> 0`, and zero canonical delta for each completed target. The four-case unit regression covers Raw Archive, raw manifest files, `registry/raw.yaml`, canonical Observation/Revision, and manifest changes by hashing the complete Knowledge tree. The earlier successful-Pi sample additionally records raw archive `0 -> 0`, unchanged `registry/raw.yaml` SHA-256, unchanged manifest digest, and canonical Entity/Source/Claim/Observation/Revision counts `0 -> 0`.

Reports and Bundles live in the separate runtime report/bundle stores. In the four-run production artifact, all four JSON reports, Markdown reports, and Bundles reloaded; each report had zero canonical references and zero section Source/Claim refs, which resolve vacuously against the registry. Real HTTPS links to EastMoney and CNINFO were preserved.

### Real production data and gross-margin results

The production path was `ApplicationRuntime -> ResearchDispatchService.startAsync -> ResearchService -> Earnings Review Workflow -> DataResolver -> Catalog/SourcePolicy -> CNINFO/AKShare plugins -> Earnings Review Skill -> ResearchReport/ResearchBundle`. All four provider runs completed with CNINFO filing evidence and AKShare-retrieved EastMoney structured actuals. Values below are from the corrected persisted-report evidence; amounts are CNY and EPS is CNY/share.

| Security / period | Revenue | Net profit | Gross margin | EPS |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 002487.SZ FY2025 | 6,173,550,246.46 | 1,103,297,424.75 | 31.1839246732% | 1.73 |
| 002487.SZ H1 2026 | 3,252,515,191.59 | 600,567,001.92 | 37.5254806411% | 0.94 |
| 600519.SH FY2025 | 172,054,171,890.91 | 82,320,067,101.68 | 91.1795516835% | 65.66 |
| 600519.SH H1 2026 | 92,278,072,083.21 | 44,516,880,421.86 | 89.5552128279% | 35.57 |

H1 gross-margin changes are recomputed in basis points: +935.5819 bps for 002487 and -174.4097 bps for 600519. The four current-code live-data runs deliberately exercised deterministic Workflow fallback. The single-run report-finder diagnostic is retained as a failed harness attempt and is not counted as report-reload evidence.

### Live Pi FY2025 reports

Both target periods also completed through the current-code Application/Dispatch/ResearchService production path with real `zhipu-openapi/glm-5.3-flash` Earnings synthesis. Each completed run has `reasoning.called`, `validated`, and `applied` set true, with `fallbackUsed` false for core Earnings synthesis; both reports have 14 sections, both Markdown reports and Bundles reloaded, and both have zero report-level or section-level canonical refs.

| Security | Run / evidence | Report and Bundle | Live Pi / optional path | Knowledge |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 002487.SZ FY2025 | run `a7977e63-07f2-4e50-84f1-8323e199c5c9`; `RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-FIX-001-live-pi-002487-fy-e2e.json` | Report and Markdown reloaded; Bundle `research-bundle-a7977e63-07f2-4e50-84f1-8323e199c5c9` reloaded | Two Earnings synthesis completions succeeded; five optional management-extraction calls were explicitly routed to the harness's invalid-output deterministic fallback | full tree unchanged; canonical delta 0; revision `0 -> 0`; source/claim/section ref counts 0 |
| 600519.SH FY2025 | run `a97612fd-c883-4bfa-b321-64e7e0bed05e`; completed target in `RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-FIX-001-live-pi-fy-e2e.json` | Report and Markdown reloaded; Bundle `research-bundle-a97612fd-c883-4bfa-b321-64e7e0bed05e` reloaded | Earnings synthesis validated and applied; optional management extraction reported timeouts/empty results and did not create guidance | full tree unchanged; canonical delta 0; revision `0 -> 0`; source/claim/section ref counts 0 |

The initial dual-target Pi attempt remains as diagnostic evidence in `RHL-EXEC-003-A-003-FIX-001-live-pi-fy-e2e.json`: its 002487 target hit the overall 90-minute ResearchService timeout while optional management extraction was running and therefore has no completed report or Bundle. It is not counted above. A follow-up with optional management operations explicitly routed to deterministic fallback completed 002487 and wrote the standalone artifact. The `ER26a` regression supplies three valid proposals together, confirms at least three are accepted for the report-only result, verifies zero Source/Claim refs, and hashes the complete Knowledge tree unchanged; authorized write-mode coverage remains in the same test.

### Canonical reference validation and write-mode preservation

- Read-only report-level and section-level `sourceRefs`, `claimRefs`, and `subjectRefs` are checked against the actual registry; the four current-code reports contain none. No synthetic `source:`, `claim:`, or `entity:` IDs are emitted.
- A real external HTTPS data link points to the EastMoney API endpoint `https://datacenter.eastmoney.com/securities/api/data/get`; the CNINFO URLs remain official filing PDFs and are not conflated with the aggregator metric source.
- The seeded-Company `writeKnowledge=true` regression still commits valid proposals, then confirms returned Source/Claim refs exist in the actual Knowledge registry. No-Company `writeKnowledge=true` remains read-only because no canonical Company creation was authorized.

### Full regression comparison

- Focused Earnings and acquisition suite: **68/68 passed**.
- `npm run typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run client:typecheck`: passed.
- `npm run client:build`: passed; existing Vite warning reports the 638 kB minified client chunk.
- `npm test`: client **122/122 passed**; Node **2,169 passed, 21 failed of 2,190**. The exact full failure identifier set (`file path + test name`) matches the recorded clean `origin/main` comparison: **0 new failures and 0 baseline failures cleared**. The 21 existing failures span Research Skill metadata, Theme projection, Competition Module Gateway, and validation snapshots.
- `git diff --check`: passed; only Git's Windows LF-to-CRLF notices were emitted.

### Remaining data gaps

- No same-period, pre-result actual-versus-consensus records qualified for the four sample periods. H1 forecast rows are annual and/or post-result and remain un-compared; no expectation was fabricated.
- EastMoney aggregator numeric value-version is `UNVERIFIED`; fixed historical PIT use remains blocked.
- Operating cash flow and inputs required for cash-conversion, working-capital, and FCF analysis are unavailable.
- No management-communication record was accepted. Optional model extraction timeouts do not create guidance or operating claims.
- No Knowledge Schema change, consensus algorithm change, or new provider was introduced. This task is not merged into `main`; Sol acceptance remains pending.
