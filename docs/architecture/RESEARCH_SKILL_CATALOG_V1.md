# ResearchHub Lite — Research Skill Catalog v1

This is the canonical roadmap for the single-level Research Skill architecture.
`Runtime` means currently executable and registered. `PARTIAL` and `PLANNED`
entries are intentionally not runtime registered.

## Runtime registration policy

The runtime set is the twenty-two `IMPLEMENTED` entries with an independently
executable boundary. `business_model_map` and `thesis_red_team` are
`SEMANTIC_EXECUTABLE` through the existing bounded session/Workflow reasoning
boundaries. Consensus expectations, earnings variance, guidance, estimate
revisions, forward DCF, reverse DCF, and scenario valuation are
`DETERMINISTIC_EXECUTABLE` and bind directly to the existing authoritative
calculation functions. Business driver, unit economics, financial quality,
management execution, capital allocation, and expectation gap bind to
deterministic contracts. Thesis formalization, catalyst mapping, and thesis
refresh bind to semantic executors which pass bounded model output into
deterministic contracts.
`comps_valuation` is a semantic executable with a deterministic arithmetic
boundary: the Workflow supplies the attributable peer set and the Skill
validates identity, point-in-time, comparability, metric availability, and
source evidence before reusing the shared comparable calculations. It never
creates synthetic peers. `valuation_crosscheck` remains Workflow-owned
composition, and cross-domain terminal QC is the reusable Workflow-layer
`ResearchQualityGate`; neither is a canonical Skill.

Every runtime entry records an execution class and binding in the catalog. A
deterministic entry must also expose a callable `runtimeExecutor`; a methodology
source alone is not evidence of deterministic runtime execution.

The existing composite Workflows remain the product execution boundary while
their canonical skill metadata is introduced. Their mapped skill IDs are
documented in the migration matrix and are not evidence that an unimplemented
Skill is runtime available.

FIX-002 semantic closure preserves the catalog statuses and runtime set while
narrowing deterministic authority. The industry cycle keeps utilization level
separate from direction and requires comparable transitions for confirmed
inflection; management execution treats qualitative labels as non-authoritative
and fails closed without deterministic predicates; and capital allocation gates
value assessment to applicable action types, attributable return/hurdle
evidence, and subsequent outcomes.

W4 promotes only `thesis_formalize`, `expectation_gap`, `catalyst_map`, and
`thesis_refresh`: each has a direct bounded result, executable validation, and
no canonical Knowledge mutation. Wave 5 promotes `comps_valuation` and
corrects ownership for three former catalog entries. The catalog is now 22
`IMPLEMENTED`, 0 `PARTIAL`, and 4 `PLANNED`; the four planned entries remain
visible as roadmap items. `thesis_red_team` remains the semantic peer and adds
deterministic fragility and kill-criterion evaluation without becoming a
composite Skill. FIX-001 closes semantic ownership for the three target Skills:
each calls `ReasoningExecutor` at most twice, allowlists supplied refs, and
fails closed before its deterministic validator on invalid model output.
