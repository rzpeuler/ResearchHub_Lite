# ResearchHub_Lite

ResearchHub_Lite is the active clean foundation for the ResearchHub Agent-first investment research application. It is built on the Pi Coding Agent and preserves the deterministic Knowledge architecture needed for safe durable research.

## Product model

```text
User
  → Pi Coding Agent
  → Free Research / Knowledge Query / Knowledge Production
```

- **Free Research** is exploratory and non-persistent by default.
- **Knowledge Query** is read-only and returns bounded Knowledge projections or references.
- **Knowledge Production** is explicit durable work that enters a product-level Application Tool and deterministic Workflow.

Review is downstream governance for Knowledge Production, not a fourth research mode. Canonical persistence requires explicit Knowledge Production intent; an upload or attachment is not automatically ingestion.

Daily Intelligence v1 and FIX-003 are PASS / CLOSED by CTO acceptance. They provide Asia/Shanghai Morning (08:00) and Evening (20:30) Briefs from item-level public acquisition over the 43-entry catalog and four-company watchlist, with real async semantic enrichment/change assessment/synthesis, source-stage telemetry, canonical-only report provenance, explicit unavailable/blocked states, and no fabricated consensus. Durable proposals now require current Change Assessment durable eligibility; Pi structured output uses bounded transport normalization plus strict reference validation and deterministic gaps. Runtime, CLI, Scheduler, and Pi entrypoints share one narrow product composition. M3 Research Coverage Architecture v0.1 is PASS / FROZEN by CTO decision, while M3A implementation is not started. Use `npm run brief:morning` / `npm run brief:evening`, the Pi Daily Intelligence tools, or the `/api/daily-briefs` routes.

## Current architecture

Pi Coding Agent is the canonical application host. ResearchHub directly reuses Pi's Agent loop, `ModelRuntime`, authentication, provider/model catalog, file-backed settings, Skills/Extensions, normal coding-agent tools, and session/runtime facilities. Agent-host portability is not a current product requirement.

ResearchHub owns the product semantics:

- `app/pi/` — Pi application session and product-level tools;
- `workflows/` — deterministic lifecycle, routing, validation, and write authorization;
- `skills/` — ResearchHub semantic research Skills;
- `plugins/` — document, evidence, and host integration;
- `knowledge/` — Schema, provenance, resolution, validation, and canonical persistence;
- `runtime-data/` — runtime Knowledge Base data;
- `tests/` — deterministic and integration regressions.

`app/services/` now provides the thin Application Service layer shared by Pi Application Tools and future UI/API surfaces. The implemented v0.1 surface is bounded Knowledge query, explicit document ingestion, process-scoped Workflow status/cancel, and read-only durable Review access. It is not a generic service framework.

Application Runtime v0.1: PASS / CLOSED. Homepage Shell v0.1 is implemented pending CTO acceptance. It provides a local Node.js runtime with persistent Pi conversations, HTTP JSON APIs, normalized SSE, controlled workspace attachments, Workflow observation/cancellation, and loopback/origin/runtime-token protection, plus a same-origin React + TypeScript + Vite browser client. See [Application Runtime & Client Architecture v0.1](docs/architecture/RESEARCHHUB_APPLICATION_RUNTIME_CLIENT_ARCHITECTURE_V0.1.md).

Personal Research v1 Company Research foundation is **PASS / CLOSED** by CTO acceptance at `7a1453179979ef2680165f79c3119656ee03c3a1`, on an explicit Schema 0.4 / Storage 1 fresh-KB lane. Empty/failed provider payloads are diagnostic-only, Raw identity is separated from provenance-context Source identity, Claim temporal scope is semantic, and canonical mutation remains behind the Validator-issued ChangeSet and shared Writer. The `research_company` Application Service, Pi tool, and optional HTTP Product API run bounded official-disclosure, AKShare, GDELT, and RSS acquisition, produce a Markdown report and non-canonical ResearchSignals, then pass semantic proposals through the producer-neutral Knowledge Production Gateway. See [Personal Research v1 Architecture](docs/architecture/PERSONAL_RESEARCH_V1_ARCHITECTURE.md), [Reuse Audit](docs/engineering/PERSONAL_RESEARCH_V1_REUSE_AUDIT.md), and [Fix 002 evidence](tests/validation/evidence/RHL_PERSONAL_RESEARCH_V1_FOUNDATION_FIX_002_SUMMARY.md).

## Run the local Homepage

```text
npm install
npm run client:build
npm run researchhub
```

The Runtime prints its loopback URL. Open it in a browser; the client is served by the same Runtime origin. The Application Shell provides Research (`/` and `/research`), a read-only Knowledge Graph Projection page (`/graph`), and a read-only Review Inbox (`/reviews`). Graph uses the bounded Directory and rooted graph APIs over active canonical Entities and Relations; Claims and Sources remain Inspector detail. Research contains the Agent conversation shell, Attachments, Workflow observation, Review notifications, and Company Research when a Schema 0.4 Knowledge Base is mounted. Theme Research, Industry Research, and ReviewDecision remain separate capabilities.

`ReasoningExecutor` remains the Workflow semantic-operation boundary and deterministic testing seam. It is not a product-level host-portability architecture. Conversation context and Workflow semantic context remain separate even when they share Pi `ModelRuntime`.

Application Tools expose product actions such as query, ingestion, workflow status/cancel, and Review reads. They must not expose Knowledge mutation primitives such as `create_entity`, `create_relation`, `create_claim`, `create_changeset`, `commit_changeset`, or `write_registry`.

Pi Agent Skills under `.pi/skills/` are host/Agent capabilities. ResearchHub Skills under `skills/` provide domain methodology. Neither changes the canonical mutation boundary: durable Knowledge changes pass through the ResearchHub Knowledge Production path, validated ChangeSet, and Writer.

Workspace files, uploads, and attachments may be read or analyzed during Free Research. Formal canonical ingestion starts only after explicit Knowledge Production intent and establishes the required Raw/Source provenance.

## Current ingestion direction

```text
Intake & Raw Archive
        ↓
Parse Structured Document
        ↓
Understand + Plan
        ↓
Deterministic Plan Validation
        ↓
Bounded Parallel Extraction + Per-Unit Validation
        ↓
Candidate Consolidation
        ↓
Retrieve Existing Knowledge
        ↓
Deterministic Knowledge Resolution + bounded Semantic Cases
        ↓
Resolve References + Plan ChangeSet
        ↓
Final Deterministic Validation
        ↓
Atomic Write
        ↓
Reload & Verify
```

LLM reasoning owns semantic decomposition; Workflow owns execution control; deterministic code owns plan admissibility and Knowledge integrity.

## Governance and architecture

Start with [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), then read the governance and architecture documents:

- [ResearchHub Application Interaction Architecture v0.1](docs/architecture/RESEARCHHUB_APPLICATION_INTERACTION_ARCHITECTURE_V0.1.md)
- [Knowledge Production Architecture v0.1](docs/architecture/KNOWLEDGE_PRODUCTION_ARCHITECTURE_V0.1.md)
- [Review Governance v0.1](docs/architecture/REVIEW_GOVERNANCE_V0.1.md)
- [Governance Architecture](docs/governance/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- [Current Status](docs/governance/CURRENT_STATUS.md)

Migration material remains available as historical, selective reuse guidance; ResearchHub_Lite is not a clone of the original ResearchHub.
